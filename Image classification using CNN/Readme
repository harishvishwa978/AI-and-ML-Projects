👓 Automatic Glasses Detection using CNN

This project focuses on detecting whether a person in an image is wearing glasses or not using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
The model helps improve facial recognition and soft biometric systems by identifying the presence of glasses, even under varying light and facial conditions.

🎯 Project Objective

To build a CNN-based image classification model capable of distinguishing between two classes:

With Glasses

Without Glasses

🧩 Project Overview

Images from both classes were visualized to understand dataset structure and variation.
Preprocessing and image augmentation techniques were applied to make the model robust against lighting, occlusions, and pose variations.

⚙️ Model Architecture

The CNN model includes the following layers:

Convolution Layers: Extract key visual features from input images.

Pooling Layers: Reduce image dimensions while retaining important features.

Dropout Layers: Prevent overfitting during training.

Dense Layers: Perform binary classification (with/without glasses).

Activation Function: ReLU
Optimizer: Adam
Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy
Evaluation Metric: Accuracy

📈 Parameter Explanation

Filters & Kernel Size: Define feature extraction detail; more filters capture finer details but increase computation.

Stride & Padding: Control how filters move across the image, influencing output size.

Dropout Rate: Randomly disables neurons to prevent overfitting.

Learning Rate: Controls the speed of model weight updates.

🌄 Image Augmentation Inference

Image augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, flipping, and brightness adjustment were used to simulate real-world conditions.
This increased dataset variability and improved model generalization.

🔁 Epochs and Batch Size Inference

Epochs: Increasing epochs improved model accuracy up to an optimal point (around 20–25), after which overfitting started.

Batch Size: A batch size of 32 provided stable convergence and efficient training.

🧪 Results

Model Accuracy: ~90% on test data

CNN successfully classified people with and without glasses in most cases.

💡 Key Takeaways

Learned the impact of CNN architecture and parameter tuning on model performance.

Understood how data augmentation enhances generalization.

Gained experience in applying deep learning techniques to image classification tasks.
